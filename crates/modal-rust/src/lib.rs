//! modal-rust: the user-facing facade. One dependency for App/Function + sdk.
//!
//! - [`Function::local`] runs the registered handler IN-PROCESS via the frozen
//!   [`Registry`] (zero Modal, zero network) and returns the typed output. This
//!   mirrors Modal Python's `Function.local()` = `raw_f(*args)`.
//! - [`Function::remote`] runs the handler REMOTELY on Modal (the RUN path): the
//!   source crate is uploaded as a mount, `cargo build` runs IN THE FUNCTION BODY
//!   at invoke time, and the freshly built `modal_runner` execs the handler —
//!   returning the SAME typed `Result` as `.local()`. Requires
//!   [`App::connect`](crate::App::connect).
//! - [`Function::spawn`] fire-and-forget enqueues one input on Modal and returns a
//!   [`FunctionCall`] handle immediately; [`FunctionCall::get`] fetches the result
//!   later. [`Function::map`] fans out N inputs and collects the outputs in INPUT
//!   ORDER. Both drive the SAME RUN path as `.remote()` and require
//!   [`App::connect`](crate::App::connect).
//!
//! # Quick start (single-dep App/Function path)
//!
//! ```rust
//! use modal_rust::App;
//! use example_add::{modal_registry, AddInput, AddOutput};
//!
//! let app = App::local_with_registry(modal_registry()); // or App::local()
//! let out: AddOutput = app
//!     .function("add")
//!     .local(AddInput { a: 40, b: 2 })
//!     .unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(out.sum, 42);
//! ```
//!
//! # Using `#[modal_rust::function]` (a single-dep story)
//!
//! The [`function`] attribute is re-exported here so it is spellable as
//! `#[modal_rust::function]` without the `extern crate ... as modal_rust;` alias
//! hack. Its expansion routes every runtime / `inventory` path THROUGH this facade —
//! `::<facade>::__private::runtime::...` and `::<facade>::__private::inventory::...`
//! (the macro resolves `<facade>` via `proc-macro-crate`, honoring a rename) — so a
//! crate using `#[modal_rust::function]` needs ONLY `modal-rust` as its modal
//! dependency (plus `serde`/`anyhow` for the handler types). The macro submits one
//! facade-owned [`Registration`] record that atomically carries both dispatch and
//! control-plane metadata:
//!
//! ```toml
//! modal-rust = { path = "..." }  # facade: App/Function/sdk + `function` + macro deps
//! serde      = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
//! anyhow     = "1"
//! ```
//!
//! This mirrors how `serde_derive` routes `::serde::...` through the `serde` facade
//! and `clap_derive` through `clap`, so the user carries one dependency, not three.
//! See [`__private`] for the re-exports the macro names.

// (1) Control-plane SDK, namespaced as `modal_rust::sdk`. Gated on `client`: the SDK
//     is an optional dep, so the light (default) build does not re-export it.
#[cfg(feature = "client")]
pub use modal_rust_sdk as sdk;

// (2) Runtime essentials that appear in the facade's public API / error paths.
//     Selective — NOT a glob — so `__macro_support`/`codec` stay out of the
//     facade's stable surface.

// `typed!` is #[macro_export] at the runtime crate root; re-export it for users who
// build a Registry by hand through the facade.
pub use modal_rust_runtime::typed;

// (3) Proc-macro re-exports. Make `#[modal_rust::function]` and
//     `modal_rust::modal_runner!()` spellable without the alias hack (see the crate
//     docs above for the downstream-dep caveat). `function` is the handler
//     attribute; `modal_runner!()` expands to the runner `main()` (the whole
//     `src/bin/modal_runner.rs` in one line, with NO `__private` in user code).
